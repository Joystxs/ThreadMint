# ThreadMint ðŸ§µ

A decentralized fashion authenticity verification system built on Stacks blockchain using Clarity smart contracts with integrated marketplace functionality and multi-signature authentication for high-value items.

## Overview

ThreadMint combats fashion counterfeiting by creating immutable digital certificates for authentic fashion items. Each item receives a unique NFT-like token that tracks its authenticity, ownership history, and resale value. The integrated marketplace allows users to buy and sell authenticated items with built-in escrow protection. For high-value items (â‰¥100,000 STX microunits), the system requires multi-signature verification from multiple brand representatives to ensure maximum authenticity assurance.

## Features

- **Brand Certification**: Register authorized fashion brands with representative management
- **Multi-signature Authentication**: Require multiple brand representatives to verify high-value items
- **Item Authentication**: Mint authenticated fashion items with detailed metadata
- **Ownership Tracking**: Complete ownership history and transfer capabilities
- **Authenticity Verification**: Verify item authenticity with scoring system
- **Resale Value Tracking**: Track item value through ownership transfers
- **Marketplace Integration**: List items for sale with STX payments and enhanced security for high-value items
- **Escrow System**: Secure buyer-seller transactions with time-limited escrow
- **Purchase Protection**: Automated refunds for expired transactions
- **Representative Management**: Add/remove brand representatives for multi-sig operations

## Multi-signature Authentication

### High-Value Item Protection
Items with estimated values â‰¥100,000 STX microunits require multi-signature verification:
- **Automatic Detection**: System automatically flags high-value items during minting
- **Verification Process**: Requires signatures from 2+ brand representatives
- **Time-Limited**: Verification requests expire after ~7 days
- **Enhanced Security**: High-value marketplace listings require authenticity score â‰¥90

### Multi-signature Workflow
1. **Mint High-Value Item**: Item created with `requires-multisig: true`, `certified: false`
2. **Create Verification**: Brand representative initiates verification request
3. **Collect Signatures**: Multiple representatives sign the verification
4. **Auto-Complete**: Item automatically certified when sufficient signatures collected

4. Deploy locally: `clarinet console`

## Usage

### Basic Authentication
```clarity
;; Register a brand (admin only)
(contract-call? .threadmint register-brand "Nike")

;; Add brand representatives (admin only)
(contract-call? .threadmint add-brand-representative "Nike" 'SP1234567890ABCDEF)
(contract-call? .threadmint add-brand-representative "Nike" 'SP0987654321FEDCBA)

;; Mint a regular fashion item
(contract-call? .threadmint mint-fashion-item 
  "Nike" 
  "Air Max 90" 
  "US-10" 
  "White" 
  "Leather/Mesh" 
  u20240101 
  'SP1234567890
  u50000) ;; Below threshold - auto-certified

;; Mint a high-value fashion item
(contract-call? .threadmint mint-fashion-item 
  "Nike" 
  "Air Jordan 1 Retro High OG" 
  "US-10" 
  "Chicago" 
  "Premium Leather" 
  u20240101 
  'SP1234567890
  u150000) ;; Above threshold - requires multi-sig
```

### Multi-signature Verification
```clarity
;; Create verification request (brand representative)
(contract-call? .threadmint create-multisig-verification u2)

;; Sign verification (first representative)
(contract-call? .threadmint sign-verification u1)

;; Sign verification (second representative) - auto-completes certification
(contract-call? .threadmint sign-verification u1)
```

### Marketplace Operations
```clarity
;; List regular item for sale
(contract-call? .threadmint list-item-for-sale u1 u75000)

;; List high-value item for sale (requires authenticity score â‰¥90)
